🔥 Core Concepts Behind MindSense AI
Text Analysis:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect emotional tones.

Voice Analysis:

Audio feature extraction (MFCCs, Chroma features) for stress pattern recognition.

Classification Models:

Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks trained on mental health datasets.

Risk Assessment:

Scoring based on detected symptoms and behaviors.

📢 Important Notes
Ensure your microphone permissions are enabled for voice analysis.

Voice recordings are stored temporarily and securely deleted after processing.

Future updates will include cloud storage, mobile support, and chatbot integration.
